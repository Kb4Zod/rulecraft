rules:
  - id: concentration
    title: Concentration
    subcategory: Mechanics
    page: 233
    content: |
      Some spells require concentration to maintain. You can only concentrate on one spell at a time.

      **Breaking Concentration:**
      - Casting another concentration spell
      - Taking damage (DC 10 or half damage taken Constitution save, whichever is higher)
      - Being incapacitated or killed
      - Environmental interference (DM's discretion, typically DC 10 Constitution save)

      **Duration:** Concentration can last up to the spell's duration. You can end it voluntarily at any time (no action required).

  - id: spell-slots
    title: Spell Slots
    subcategory: Mechanics
    page: 231
    content: |
      Casting a spell of 1st level or higher expends a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all spent spell slots when you finish a long rest.

      **Upcasting:** Many spells can be cast using a higher-level slot for enhanced effects. The spell description specifies these benefits.

      **Cantrips:** Cantrips don't use spell slots and can be cast at will.

  - id: spell-components
    title: Spell Components
    subcategory: Mechanics
    page: 232
    content: |
      Spells may require verbal (V), somatic (S), and/or material (M) components.

      **Verbal (V):** You must speak words of power. Can't cast if silenced.

      **Somatic (S):** You must gesture with at least one free hand. Can't cast while hands are bound.

      **Material (M):** You need specific items, which can be substituted with a component pouch or arcane focus. If a cost is listed, you must have that specific item. If the component is consumed, you must provide it each casting.

  - id: casting-time
    title: Casting Time
    subcategory: Mechanics
    page: 232
    content: |
      Most spells require one action to cast. Some have different casting times:

      - **Bonus Action:** Cast as a bonus action. If you cast a bonus action spell, you can only cast a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action on the same turn.
      - **Reaction:** Cast in response to a specific trigger.
      - **1 Minute or Longer:** Requires concentration while casting. Damage or interruption ruins the spell.

  - id: spell-range
    title: Spell Range
    subcategory: Targeting
    page: 233
    content: |
      Every spell has a range indicating how far the effect can reach from the caster.

      **Range Types:**
      - **Self:** Targets only you (some Self spells have areas of effect originating from you)
      - **Touch:** Must touch the target
      - **Specific Distance:** Target must be within that distance
      - **Unlimited:** Can target across any distance (rare, typically interplanar spells)

  - id: spell-targets
    title: Spell Targets
    subcategory: Targeting
    page: 234
    content: |
      A spell's description specifies valid targets. You must have a clear path to the target unless the spell can penetrate cover.

      **Line of Effect:** Most spells require an unobstructed path between you and the target. Total cover typically blocks spells.

      **Targeting Yourself:** If a spell says "a creature you can see" and you can see yourself (not blinded), you can target yourself.

  - id: areas-of-effect
    title: Areas of Effect
    subcategory: Targeting
    page: 234
    content: |
      Spells that affect an area have specific shapes:

      **Cone:** Spreads from origin point, widening as it extends. Width equals length at any point.

      **Cube:** Size equals side length. Origin is one face, or center if specified.

      **Cylinder:** Radius and height specified. Origin can be ground or air.

      **Line:** Length and width specified. Travels in straight line from origin.

      **Sphere:** Radius specified from center point.

      **Point of Origin:** You choose the origin within range, but typically can't move it after casting.

  - id: saving-throws-spells
    title: Saving Throws Against Spells
    subcategory: Mechanics
    page: 235
    content: |
      Many spells allow targets to make saving throws to resist effects. The spell specifies the ability used.

      **Spell Save DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier**

      **Partial Effects:** Some spells deal half damage on a successful save. The spell description specifies what happens on success or failure.

  - id: spell-attacks
    title: Spell Attack Rolls
    subcategory: Mechanics
    page: 235
    content: |
      Some spells require an attack roll to hit. This follows the same rules as weapon attacks.

      **Spell Attack Modifier = proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier**

      **Types:**
      - **Melee Spell Attack:** Target must be within reach (usually touch)
      - **Ranged Spell Attack:** Target must be within range; disadvantage if hostile creature within 5 feet

  - id: combining-magical-effects
    title: Combining Magical Effects
    subcategory: Mechanics
    page: 235
    content: |
      The effects of different spells add together while their durations overlap. However, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine.

      **Same Spell, Different Casters:** Only the most potent effect applies (highest spell slot or caster level). If equal, the most recent casting applies.

      **Example:** Two bless spells on the same target don't stack; only one applies.

  - id: ritual-casting
    title: Ritual Casting
    subcategory: Mechanics
    page: 236
    content: |
      Spells with the ritual tag can be cast as rituals, which takes 10 extra minutes but doesn't expend a spell slot.

      **Requirements:**
      - You must have the ritual casting feature (Cleric, Druid, Wizard, etc.)
      - Some classes require the spell be prepared; others only need it in their spellbook
      - You still need required components

  - id: cantrips
    title: Cantrips
    subcategory: Spell Levels
    page: 231
    content: |
      Cantrips are 0-level spells that can be cast at will without using spell slots or being prepared in advance.

      **Scaling:** Many cantrips increase in power at certain character levels (5th, 11th, 17th), not class levels.

      **Learning:** Once learned, a cantrip is known permanently (can't be swapped on level-up for most classes).

  - id: spell-preparation
    title: Preparing Spells
    subcategory: Mechanics
    page: 231
    content: |
      Some classes (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Wizard) prepare a list of spells each day after a long rest.

      **Prepared Spell Limit:** Usually equals spellcasting ability modifier + class level (minimum of one spell).

      **Casting:** You can cast any prepared spell using an available spell slot.

      **Changing Spells:** You can change your prepared spells at the end of a long rest.

  - id: known-spells
    title: Known Spells
    subcategory: Mechanics
    page: 231
    content: |
      Some classes (Bard, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock) know a fixed number of spells rather than preparing them.

      **Spells Known:** Determined by class table.

      **Swapping Spells:** When you gain a level, you can replace one known spell with another of a level you can cast.

      **Always Available:** Your known spells are always available to cast (no daily preparation).

  - id: spellcasting-focus
    title: Spellcasting Focus
    subcategory: Components
    page: 232
    content: |
      A spellcasting focus can replace material components that don't have a cost and aren't consumed.

      **Focus Types:**
      - **Arcane Focus:** Crystal, orb, rod, staff, or wand (for Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards)
      - **Druidic Focus:** Sprig of mistletoe, totem, wooden staff, or yew wand
      - **Holy Symbol:** Amulet, emblem, or reliquary (can be emblazoned on shield)
      - **Musical Instrument:** For Bards

  - id: dispel-magic
    title: Dispelling and Countering
    subcategory: Interactions
    page: 236
    content: |
      Spells can be ended early through various means:

      **Dispel Magic:** Ends spells of 3rd level or lower automatically. Higher-level spells require an ability check (DC = 10 + spell's level).

      **Counterspell:** Cast as a reaction to stop a spell being cast. Works automatically if the target spell is 3rd level or lower. Higher-level spells require an ability check.

      **Antimagic Field:** Suppresses magical effects within its area.

  - id: spell-scrolls
    title: Spell Scrolls
    subcategory: Magic Items
    page: 236
    content: |
      A spell scroll contains a single spell in written form. Reading it casts the spell without components.

      **Requirements:**
      - Spell must be on your class's spell list
      - If higher level than you can cast, make an ability check (DC = 10 + spell level)

      **Consumption:** The scroll crumbles after use.

      **Copying (Wizard):** A Wizard can copy a scroll into their spellbook (destroys the scroll).

  - id: multiclass-spellcasting
    title: Multiclass Spellcasting
    subcategory: Mechanics
    page: 232
    content: |
      When multiclassing between spellcasting classes, spell slots are determined by combined levels using a formula.

      **Known/Prepared Spells:** Determined separately for each class. You can only learn spells you could normally access with that class's level.

      **Slot Calculation:**
      - Full casters (Wizard, Cleric, etc.): Full level
      - Half casters (Paladin, Ranger): Half level (round down)
      - Third casters (Eldritch Knight, Arcane Trickster): One-third level (round down)

      Add these together and consult the multiclass spell slot table.

  - id: darkness-light-spells
    title: Light and Darkness Spells
    subcategory: Interactions
    page: 235
    content: |
      When light and darkness magic overlap, their spell levels determine the outcome.

      **Higher Level Wins:** A higher-level light spell dispels darkness, and vice versa.

      **Equal Levels:** The areas of overlapping light and darkness cancel out, creating normal conditions.

      **Example:** Daylight (3rd level) dispels darkness (2nd level) in the overlapping area.

      - Some class features recharge on a short rest (Fighter's Second Wind, Warlock's spell slots, etc.)

      Characters need regular food and water to survive.

      - Water: 1 gallon per day (2 gallons in hot weather)

      **Going Without Food:**
      - Can go days equal to 3 + Constitution modifier before starving
      - Each day beyond that, gain 1 level of exhaustion
      - Resets when you eat

      **Going Without Water:**
      - Gain 1 exhaustion level at end of each day without enough water
      - 2 levels if already exhausted
      - Drinking half requirement still counts as without water

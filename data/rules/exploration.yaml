      - **Darkness:** Heavily obscured; effectively blind unless you have darkvision

      **Darkvision:** See in darkness as dim light (typically 60 feet). Can't discern color, only shades of gray.

  - id: obscured-areas
    title: Obscured Areas
    subcategory: Environment
    page: 182

      Some environmental effects block vision.

  - id: climbing-swimming
    title: Climbing and Swimming
    subcategory: Movement
    page: 182
    content: |
      Moving through challenging terrain costs extra movement.

      **Climbing:** Each foot of climbing costs 1 extra foot of movement (2 extra in difficult terrain). May require Strength (Athletics) check for difficult surfaces.

      **Swimming:** Each foot costs 1 extra foot of movement. May require Strength (Athletics) check in rough water.

      **Climbing/Swimming Speed:** If you have one, climbing or swimming doesn't cost extra movement.

  - id: jumping
    title: Jumping
    subcategory: Movement
    page: 182
    content: |
      Characters can jump to cross gaps or reach heights.

      **Long Jump:** With a 10-foot running start, jump a number of feet equal to your Strength score. Standing long jump is half that. May need Athletics check to clear obstacles.

      **High Jump:** With a 10-foot running start, leap feet equal to 3 + Strength modifier. Standing high jump is half that. Arms can reach 1.5x your height above you.

      **Difficult Terrain:** Land in difficult terrain requires DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone.

  - id: traps
    title: Finding and Disabling Traps
    subcategory: Hazards
    page: 183
    content: |
      Traps are hidden dangers that punish the unwary.

      **Detecting Traps:**
      - Passive Perception or Passive Investigation may notice traps
      - Active searching uses Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation)
      - DM sets DC based on trap complexity

      **Disabling Traps:**
      - Typically requires thieves' tools and a Dexterity check
      - Failure might trigger the trap
      - Some traps can be bypassed rather than disabled

  - id: foraging
    title: Foraging
    subcategory: Survival
    page: 183
    content: |
      Characters can search for food and water while traveling.

      **Making the Check:** Wisdom (Survival) check while traveling at normal or slow pace.

      **DC by Terrain:**
      - Abundant (forest, coast): DC 10
      - Limited (hills, tundra): DC 15
      - Scarce (desert, arctic): DC 20

      **Success:** Find 1d6 + Wisdom modifier pounds of food and gallons of water (or enough for 1d6 + Wis mod creatures for one day).

  - id: navigation
    title: Navigation
    subcategory: Travel
    page: 181
    content: |
      When traveling through wilderness, someone must navigate.

      **Navigator's Role:** Make a Wisdom (Survival) check to stay on course.

      **Getting Lost:** If the check fails, the party gets lost. Travel in a random direction, wasting time.

      **DC Factors:**
      - Familiar terrain: DC 10
      - Unfamiliar terrain: DC 15
      - Poor visibility or weather: +5 to DC

    subcategory: Travel
    page: 181
    content: |
      Groups can try to move without being noticed.

      **Requirements:** Must travel at a slow pace.

      **Group Stealth:** Each character makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check. If at least half succeed, the group remains undetected by passive observation.

      **Scouts:** Characters can scout ahead, moving stealthily while the main group travels normally.

  - id: encounter-distance
    title: Encounter Distance
    subcategory: Encounters
    page: 181

      **Factors:**
      - Terrain (open plains vs. dense forest)
      - Visibility (daylight vs. darkness)
      - Whether either group was using Stealth

      **Typical Distances:**
      - Outdoors (open): 6d6 x 10 feet
      - Outdoors (terrain): 2d8 x 10 feet
      - Indoors: 2d10 x 5 feet (or line of sight in corridors)
